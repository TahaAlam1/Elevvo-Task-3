🌲 Forest Cover Type Classification

🚀 Elevvo Internship – Task 3

📌 Project Overview

This project tackles a multi-class classification problem using the UCI Covertype dataset to predict forest cover types based on 54 cartographic and environmental features.

🔍 Workflow:

Data exploration & visualization

Data preprocessing (scaling, encoding)

Model training: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost

Model evaluation: accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report, feature importance

📊 Dataset

Source: UCI Covertype Dataset

Features: 54

Target: Forest Cover Type (7 classes)

⚙️ Models & Accuracy
Model	Accuracy	Notes
Logistic Regression	72%	Simple baseline
Random Forest	95%	Best performance, handles class imbalance
XGBoost	81%	Strong per-class predictions
🧠 Key Takeaways

Ensemble models outperform basic regression for complex, multi-class problems.

Data preprocessing is crucial for performance.

Confusion matrix helps identify class-specific issues.
